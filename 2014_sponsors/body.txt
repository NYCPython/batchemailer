Hi {{first_names}} -

Once again, a huge thank you to {{company_name}} for sponsoring PyGotham 2014!

I'm reaching out because we're getting ready for PyGotham 2015, and we'd love {{company_name}} to be a big part of it.

PyGotham 2015 will be August 15-16, at the AMA conference center in Times Square, with over 350 attendees from diverse backgrounds in many different industries. Sponsorship details can be found on our prospectus page:

As a supporter, {{company_name}} will also get great visibility with regards to diversity. Last year, 46 women and other minorities were recipients of scholarships, thanks to our wonderful sponsors.

Let me know what you think?

Thanks!
